Self-made Java file compressor program based on Huffman's lossless compression algorithm


## Lessons Learned

I've been able to implement the Huffman compressions algorithm in Java. I wanted to make this project to apply what I learned in the classroom to a real project. I used a binary tree and hashmap to implement it. I want to now work with files rather than the standard input.
